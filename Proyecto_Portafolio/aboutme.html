In this section I am going to tell you a little about what are the skills that I handle in the field of programming. I've been a student for a couple of years now and I'll be a student
                    for life, because this is something that never stops innovating. I have management of different languages ​​such as Java, I have management of the database, and on the Front end I get along very well with HTML5, CSS3, React and JavaScript.
                    I get along very well with the Front End, but never neglect the Back end part, that's why today I have better knowledge in the specific language of Java, since I received two scholarships to be a Full Stack programmer with a Java orientation.
                    So I can highlight from my skills the good use of Java as a backend and the entire Front End area.</h2>

            <h2 class="textosobremi2">I have very good teamwork, communication and leadership skills. I am fluent in Spanish and English, both conversational and writing, so it is not a problem for me to adapt to different workers from other cultures and languages. In this portfolio
                you can find the <a class="testimonialsb nav" href="testimonials.html">Testimonials</a> section, where you will see a small summary dictated by people with whom I have already worked before, on the other hand, telling what was the experience
                of working with me. If you want to know something more about my skills, here below I leave you a contact button so you can write to me and ask me what you want.</h2>
